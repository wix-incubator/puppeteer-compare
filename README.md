# PROJECT_NAME

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wix-incubator/puppeteer-compare.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wix-incubator/puppeteer-compare)

PROJECT_NAME is a CLI tool for creating comparable image/video artefact.

### Tech

PROJECT_NAME uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) - Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.
* [Commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) - The complete solution for node.js command-line interfaces.
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
* [node-fluent-ffmpeg](https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg) - A fluent Node.js API to FFMPEG.
* [gif-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gif-encoder) - Streaming GIF encoder
    
And of course PROJECT_NAME itself is open source with a [public repository][https://github.com/wix-incubator/puppeteer-compare] on GitHub.

### Installation

PROJECT_NAME requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm install
npm run example:full # generates both gif and video
```
